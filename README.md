# Sign-In-and-Audit-Logs

Azure AD provides users access to three activity logs:
- Sign-ins - information about sign-ins and how your resources are used by your users
- Audit: information about changes to your tenant such as users and group management or updates applied to your tenant's resources
- Provisioning: activities performed by the provisioning service, such as the creation of a group in ServiceNow or a user imported from Workday.

What can you do with it?
- You can use the sign-ins log to find answers to questions like:
- - What is the sign-in pattern of a user?
- - How many users have signed in over a week?
- - Whatâ€™s the status of these sign-ins?

Who can access it?
- You can always access your own sign-ins history using this link: https://mysignins.microsoft.com

To access the sign-ins log, you need to be:
- A global administrator </br>
- A user in one of the following roles:
- - Security administrator
- - Security reader
- - Global reader
- - Reports reader
